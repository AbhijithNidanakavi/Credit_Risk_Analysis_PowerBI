# Credit_Risk_Analysis_PowerBI
This project focuses on creating a comprehensive credit card dashboard using Power BI, incorporating Postgre SQL and DAX queries.  The dashboard offers real-time insights into key performance metrics and trends, allowing stakeholders to effectively monitor and analyze credit card operations. 
It provides visualizations for both customer and credit card profiles, presenting a complete picture of usage patterns. 
The dashboard includes features for both weekly and quarterly reports, offering a detailed overview of credit card performance over time. 
In conclusion, the dashboard provides stakeholders with valuable tools to make informed decisions and drive improvements in credit card operations.

**Technology Stack :**
**PostgreSQL:** Utilized for data storage and management.
